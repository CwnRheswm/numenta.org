> I need help writing this page. Details are in the sections below. I'm open to an entirely different structure, this is just a preliminary outline.

# Importance of the Cortical Learning Algorithm

> Some people who come to numenta.org don't get the impact this technology will have to how we compute in the future. I would like this page explain **why** this technology is important, to address some of [these obstacles defined in our Consumer Engagement Strategy](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/NuPIC-Consumer-Engagement-Strategy#watcher--builder-obstacles).

## NuPIC vs. Other ML Techniques

> How is NuPIC different from other ML techniques? And why would someone be interested in studying and trying out NuPIC instead of other more tested and standard machine learning technologies?

## Data Overload

> We have so much data, and it's growing exponentially. Explain how impossible it is for us to understand all this data without truly intelligent machines, and how NuPIC can help move us toward a solution. Explain how human brains don't have the capacity, even collaboratively, to compute and understand all this data.

## Big Problems

> Explain some big problems facing humanity that intelligent machines can address. Some will be things like space exploration, but some could be dire problems facing our race and life on this planet.

## Future

> Don't be afraid to explore some science fictiony topics. Spark the reader's imagination.
