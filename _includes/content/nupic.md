# Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing (NuPIC)

## Getting Started

If you want to jump right into the code, we have a [Getting Started](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/Getting-Started) wiki page to help guide you.

There are a few things to be aware of before diving into NuPIC. The NuPIC source code is use by Numenta as a part of a commercial product development. Because of this, it is no longer a “pure” implementation of the algorithms. We have made optimizations, added tweaks, and taken some short cuts to improve performance. For those interested in studying and characterizing a purer form of the [CLA](cla.html) you may want to back out some of these changes or at least be aware of them. If your interest is using NuPIC in a product, then you may be happy with the code as-is or you may want to make additional changes. Another thing to consider is that the CLA is based on principles that most people are not familiar with, including [sparse distributed representations](cla.html#sparse_distributed_representations), [online learning](cla.html#online_learning), and distributed memory. There is a steeper than normal learning curve.

## Requirements

We're working in providing virtual machines ready to run NuPIC so Windows developers can work on NuPIC within [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org). Currently, the build requirements are:

* Linux or Unix environment with gnu compilers
* Python 2.6 or 2.7
