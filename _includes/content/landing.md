This is the homepage for the **_Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing_** (**[NuPIC](nupic.html)**). NuPIC is an [open source](http://opensource.org/osd) software project driven by Numenta, which started from an initiative by [Jeff Hawkins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hawkins) to build intelligent machines. You can read about his ideas in the book **[On Intelligence](http://www.amazon.com/On-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B003J4VE5Y/ref=tmm_kin_title_0)**, published in 2005.

For a brief summary of why NuPIC exists and what we hope to accomplish, watch this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_eT5bsS4bQ" rel="prettyPhoto" title="">short video</a> recently given at [OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/speaker/130998) or read [Jeff's introductory blog post about NuPIC]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2013/06/03/introducing-nupic.html).

Many more detailed videos about these concepts are available on our [media page](media.html).
