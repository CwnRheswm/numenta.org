Biological and Machine Intelligence

## What is this?

“Biological and Machine Intelligence” is a document for engineers and scientists who want to build intelligent machines.  It describes the theory behind the source code in NuPIC .  It also goes further into neocortical theory covering topics that are not yet implemented in NuPIC and some that are only partially understood.  You can think of it as a roadmap for machine intelligence based on cortical modeling.  Part of the map covers the code in NuPIC and part of it is a chart of where we need to go.

“Biological and Machine Intelligence” is written in a book format and may one day be an actual book.  I am just getting underway writing this book and hope to make regular installments.  You are invited to help.  Let me know what sections you would like to see first.  I also welcome edits, improvements, references, and new contributions but currently there is no outside contributor process.

Ultimately this book will replace the HTM and CLA white paper but for now the white paper should be considered essential reading.
