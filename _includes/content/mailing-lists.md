# NuPIC Mailing Lists

## [\[nupic-discuss\]](http://lists.numenta.org/mailman/listinfo/nupic_lists.numenta.org)

This is our general mailing list, for discussions about NuPIC installation, usage, bug reports or any other topic that doesn't have to do with NuPIC development or theory. 

This is a friendly list where newcomers can come and ask questions about how things work (or should work). If you are just getting started with NuPIC and you want help becoming productive, this is your list.

## [\[nupic-hackers\]](http://lists.numenta.org/mailman/listinfo/nupic-hackers_lists.numenta.org)

This list is for people interested in working on the NuPIC software project. Discussions on this list include:

- new features
- bug fix proposals
- implementation discussions
- future direction of the NuPIC project

This list is probably too much for someone who just wants to *use* NuPIC.
