* NuPIC is licensed as dual commercial and [GPL version 3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)
* Commercial licenses are also available from Numenta.

The goal of the license is to require that enhancements to NuPIC be released to the community. Traditional GPL often does not achieve this anymore as a huge amount of software runs in the cloud. For example, Google has no obligation to release their improvements to the MySQL kernel â€“ if they do they are being nice.
