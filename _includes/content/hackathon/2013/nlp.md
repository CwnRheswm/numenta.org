Things the NuPIC community has already created, and existing tools that have been used for these experiments.

### [CEPT](http://www.cept.at/)

The CEPT-Retina produces semantic fingerprints of language and thereby represents a new fundamental alternative to capture the inner semantics of natural language. These fingerprints can represent words, documents or the information needs of users. This approach helps get more relevant search results and classify information more efficiently. The CEPT-Retina also enables the making of intelligent decisions based on human-generated text input.
