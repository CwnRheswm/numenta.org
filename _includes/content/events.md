        <h3><a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/30583">On Open Intelligence</a></h3>
        
        <p class="author">Jeff Hawkins</p>
        
        <p>Numenta is working on machine intelligence. Our approach is to first understand, in detail, how the neocortex works and then build systems that work on those principles. In the past few years we made good progress on both the theory and implementing the theory in software. The resulting technology is a type of memory system based on sparse representations and distributed sequence memory. Like the brain, systems built on this technology need to be trained on streaming sensory data. The system learns the spatial and temporal structure in sensory data.</p>

        <p>We have applied this technology to a commercial product called Grok. Grok is fed data from sensors, it discovers the structure in the data and uses this to make predictions and detect anomalies. Grok is being applied in diverse industries such as energy pricing, product forecasting, predictive maintenance, and finance.</p>

        <p>The technology we have created represents a new approach to machine learning and we believe it will be the fundamental component of all machine intelligence. We published the details of the theory in a white paper in 2009. There is substantial interest in working with this technology from both academics and technologists. In my talk I will describe our vision for machine intelligence. I will give a brief introduction to the technology. And I will describe why we are creating an open source project.</p>

        <h3><a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/30342">Introducing the Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing (NuPIC)</a></h3>
        
        <p class="author"><a href="http://numenta.org/tools/contributors.html#rhyolight">Matt Taylor</a>, <a href="http://numenta.org/tools/contributors.html#scottpurdy">Scott Purdy</a></p>

        <p>This new open source library is based concepts first described in Jeff Hawkins’ book On Intelligence and subsequently developed by Numenta Inc. NuPIC consists of a set of machine learning algorithms that accurately model layers of neurons in the neocortex. NuPIC’s algorithms continuously learn temporal patterns, make predictions, and detect anomalous behavior within streaming data. These are the same algorithms and code used in Numenta’s commercial product, Grok.</p>

        <p>NuPIC represents a new approach to machine learning and machine intelligence. Given the large interest we have had from people wanting to study these algorithms and apply them in novel ways we created the NuPIC open source library and the accompanying Numenta.org website.</p>

        <p>In this hands-on session, we’ll introduce NuPIC’s Online Prediction Framework (OPF) and demonstrate how one creates models using an OPF client. We’ll set up some live streaming data to pass into the client and watch as NuPIC makes online inferences, learning the changing patterns in the streaming data set. NuPIC and the OPF have been applied to many scenarios and form the foundation for Numenta’s commercial product, Grok. To master NuPIC you will have to become comfortable with concepts such as sparse distributed representations and on-line learning.</p>
