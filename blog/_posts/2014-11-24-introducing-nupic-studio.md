Hello NuPICers!

I am introducing a nice tool for the NuPIC community. [NuPIC Studio](https://github.com/nupic-community/nupic.studio) is a powerful all-in-one tool that allows users create an HTM network from scratch, train it, collect statistics, and share it among the members of the community.

It is not just a visualization tool but an HTM builder, debugger and laboratory for experiments. It is ideal for newbies with little intimacy with [NuPIC](https://github.com/numenta/nupic) code as well as experts that wish for better productivity. Among its features and advantages are:

- Users can open, save, or change their "HTM projects" or of other developers. A typical project contains data to be trained, neural network configuration, statistics, etc, which can be shared to be analyzed or integrated with other projects.
- The HTM engine is the own original NuPIC library (Python distribution). This means no port, no bindings, no re-implementation, etc. So any changes in the original NuPIC source can be immediately viewed. This helps users that wish to test improvements like new encoders or even hierarchy, attention, and motor integration.

- Source code of the HTM network architecture is automatically generated in order for users to simply copy and paste it into their applications and so consume NuPIC Network API.

- The project is pip-installable and for desktop use.

Enjoy!
