title: Open Source Phase One ACTIVATE
---

The source code is now [online](http://github.com/numenta/nupic)! The license is dual GPL/commercial. The [contribution process](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/Contributor-Model) and [development workflow](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/Developer-workflow) are still being worked out, but the great news is that we at Numenta (some folks call us [Grok Solutions](https://www.groksolutions.com/prs/pr-05-06-13.html) now) are using this exact source tree to build our commercial product, [Grok](http://groksolutions.com/product.html).

### We have processes to adjust

Doing business as Grok, we are building a commercial product on top of the NuPIC codebase. In order to give our engineers time to adjust to the open source workflow, there is going to be a transitional period of time (a month) during which we're not going to be particularly reactive to community contributions. It doesn't mean we aren't looking forward to your participation, however. We want public scrutiny and involvement in the evolution of NuPIC. It's just that we're considerably altering our process by extracting our **core logic** out of our internal codebase and into an open source project. It's a big deal to us!

Please bear with us while we take this coming month to tweak our processes and prepare ourselves for more in-depth community involvement in NuPIC. I'm sure it will take some time for the community to digest all the code within NuPIC. During that time, don't be afraid to submit pull requests that add to exiting documentation, fix spelling errors, or make other minor alterations. It will give us a chance to exercise the processes we're trying to establish.
