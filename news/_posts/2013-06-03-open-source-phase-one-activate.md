title: Open Source Phase One: ACTIVATE

The source code is now [online](http://github.com/numenta/nupic)! The license is dual GPL/commercial. A lot of things are still being worked out, but the great news is that we at Numenta (some folks call us Grok Solutions now) are using this exact source tree to build our commercial product, Grok.

#### We have processes to adjust

Because we're building a commercial product, there is going to be a transitional period of time (a month) during which we're not going to be particularly reactive to community contributions.
