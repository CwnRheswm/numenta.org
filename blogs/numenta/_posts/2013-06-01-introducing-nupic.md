title: Introducing NuPIC
---

This will be the introductory blog post once the NuPIC codebase has made it into our repository.

Either Matt or Jeff should write it. It should include:

* Reasons for OS
* Encouragement for community contributions
* Explanations of numenta.org structure and community links
